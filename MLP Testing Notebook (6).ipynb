testing notebook walks through the use of the manual and NLP feature extraction techniques and runs those features through 5 sets of MLP neural network tests. This set of 5 tests corresponds to the MLP results section in the final paper. The  two manual feature related functions and three NLP feature related functions are called from the respective .py files in the codebase.\n","\n","**References**: any code used from a source has been reference via a comment directly next to that specific line of code. All coding references used for the manual and NLP feature extraction techniques can be found directly in their respective .py files in the codebase.\n","\n","**Change 1**: some of this code has been altered from its original form in our project for purposes of working with the smaller sample dataset that was provided in this codebase. For example, all neural network model epoch counts have been reduced, as this notebook is intended to quickly run through the sample dataset provided. The neural network code itself has remained the same, however some of the hyperparameters have been changed just for ease of testing the code out.\n","\n","**Change 2**: Another change that was made in the below code is that, just for the purposes of testing this code, the sample dataset is split 80/20 for test/training of the neural network models. This was done as only one sample dataset is provided in the codebase. It should be noted that all testing scenarios reported in the final report where tested/trained on the 5 testing scenarios created for this project - all train/test data files are provided in the supplemental material link in the github.\n","\n","**Change 3**: In the final project, the Hugging Face Distilbert NLP transformer was fine tuned on a much larger sample dataset from training scenarios 1-4, and those mode parameters were saved and used for feature extraction purposes. Instead of using the existing model parameters, for the purposes of showing the process and the code used, the sample dataset provided in the codebase is used to fine tune the model directly in this file, then those model parameters are used later to extract the features. This is intened to show the user how to fine tune the model and show the code used. Please note that the actual model parameters used with the NLP in the project is provided separately in the supplemental material link in the github."],"metadata":{"id":"MmQarOGm0sDz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Table of Contents\n","\n","1.
